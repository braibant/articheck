Bernardy et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/BernardyJC10} describe a
systematic way of reducing the testing of polymorphic functions to the
testing of specific monomorphic instances of these functions.
%
Given a polymorphic property, the correctness of the reduced
(monomorphic) property entails the correctness of all other
instanciations. This yields a significant reduction in the necessary
test cases.
% They rely on a version of parametricity that does not hold in ML in
% all its generality. For instance, one should not use side effects.
%
They informally argue that their technique is efficient compared to
the standard praxis of substituting \texttt{int} for polymorphic
types.
%
Note however that both solutions to the problem of testing polymorphic
functions must be applied at the meta-level. That is, the user has to
pick the right instanciation of polymorphic type variables; this
cannot be done automatically inside the host language.
