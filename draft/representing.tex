\section{Describing a type}
\label{sec:representation}

In the context of our testing framework, we wish to describe a type using a set
of \emph{instances}, that is, of inhabitants of the type. The following data
structure makes up what we call a \emph{type descriptor}.

\begin{ocamlcode}
type 'a ty = {
  (* other implementation details omitted *)
  mutable enum: 'a PSet.t;
  fresh: ('a PSet.t -> 'a) option;
}
\end{ocamlcode}

Type descriptors record a persistent set of instances via the \code{enum}
field. Descriptors for ground types, such as \code{int}, are equipped with a
generator of \code{fresh} instances that are guaranteed to be different from the
others.
