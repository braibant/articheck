\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Software development is hard. Industry practices still rely, for the better
part, on tests to ensure the functional correctness of programs. Even in more
sophisticated circles, such as the programming language research community, not
everyone has switched to writing all their programs in Coq. Testing is thus a
cornerstone of the development cycle. Moreover, even if the end goal is to fully
certify a program using a proof assistant, it is still worthwhile to eliminate
bugs early by running a cheap, efficient test framework.

Testing boils down to two different processes: generating test cases
for test suites; then verifying that user-written assertions and
specifications of program parts are not falsified by the test suites.

\qcheck{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ClaessenH00} is a popular, efficient
tool for that purpose. First, it provides a combinator library based
on type-classes to build test case generators. Second, it provides
a principled way for the users to specify properties over
functions. For instance, users may write predicates such as ``reverse
is an involution''. Then, the \qcheck framework is able to create
\emph{instances} of the type being tested, e.g., lists of integers.
The predicate is tested against these test cases, and any
counter-example is reported to the user.

Our novel approach is motivated by some limitations of the \qcheck
framework.  When users create trees, for instance, not only do they
have to specify that leaves should be generated more often than nodes
(for otherwise the tree generation would not terminate), but they also
have to rely on a global size measure to stop generating new nodes
after a while. It is thus up to the user of the library to implement
their own logic for generating the right instances, within a
reasonable size limit, combining the various base cases.

We argue that these low-level manipulations should be taken care of by the
library. When generating binary search tree instances, one ends up
re-implementing a series of random additions and deletions, which are precisely
the functions that the code to be tested for exports. What if the testing
framework could, by itself, combine functions exported by the module we wish to
test, in order to build instances of the desired type? As long as the the module
exports its correctness properties, the library needs not see the implementation.

In the present document, we describe a library that does precisely
that, dubbed \arti. The library is written in OCaml. While \qcheck
uses type-classes as a host language feature to conduct value
generation, we show how to implement the proof search in library
code -- while remaining both type-safe and generic over the
tested interfaces, thanks to GADTs.
